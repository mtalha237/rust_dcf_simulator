A Distributed Coordination Function written in Rust.

This project implements the Distributed Coordination Function used in IEEE802.11. It simulates the backoff mechanism and RTS/CTS to measure the probability of a succesful transmission as well as the throughput. I have used the article in [1] for all the calculations.

This was a project that I have previously written in Phython and I re-wrote in Rust here.

All feedback is appreciated.
